The processing sketch is based on [this](https://medium.com/a-curious-beginners-guide-to-building-your-first/my-first-ar-exploration-with-processing-71ffaf3e7418) tutorial and the rotation example from the **nyar4psg** Library.

You might have to change the paths in the .pde file depending on where you save this sketch.

This is how it should look:
