# processingAR - Processing sketch using the webcam for AR

The processing sketch is based on [this](https://medium.com/a-curious-beginners-guide-to-building-your-first/my-first-ar-exploration-with-processing-71ffaf3e7418) tutorial and the rotation example from the **nyar4psg** Library.

You might have to change the paths in the .pde file depending on where you save this sketch.

In case of webcam access issues - [here is a fix for macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNa_ua_esmw)
1. go to applications/processing 
2. right-click "show package contents"
3. go to contents/MacOs
4. make sure processing is closed
5. open processing executable
6. now you can open the processingAR sketch & grant permission for the camera

This is how it should look:
